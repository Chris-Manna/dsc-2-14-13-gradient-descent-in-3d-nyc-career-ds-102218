    "In two dimensions, when changing just one variable, $m$ or $b$, gradient descent means stepping forwards or backwards along the cost curve and and taking a specific step size.  To determine whether to move forwards or backwards as well as the step size, we imagine standing on this two-dimension curve (shown below) and feeling the slope of our cost curve to tell us how to move.  A step in a direction means a change in one of our regression variables."

So for example, we can say for the function $f(x, y)$, take the partial derivative with respect to the variable $x$.  This means we are assessing the output after nudging in the $x$ direction, and we can express this as $\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x} $.  Our rule for taking the partial derivative is to treat the variables that we are not taking the derivative with respect to as constants.
